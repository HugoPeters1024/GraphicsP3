SCENE GRAPH:

GameObject is defined with a parent pointer and a list of children.
Every GameObject inherets the transformations of all it's parents.
You can see this in the demo as the teapot that spins around the bunny, and
the T-rex that spin around the bunny.
This setup is movement wise analogous to the sun, earth and moon.

BONUS ASSIGNMENTS:

-Multiple light instances whose positions, colors and intensity's can
be modified at run-time.

-A cube map that manifests itself as a huge skybox that move along with
the camera, creating the illusion of an enormous world.

-A cosine function using the distance from the center to create a vignette.
-Color aberration out from the center.

-Motion blur that uses the delta rotation of the camera as a 2D vector to blur
n pixels linearly interpolated over that vector. n is by default defined as 10 but
can be increased for a raise in quality.

-The camera is a kind of GameObject which means that it can inherent from other
objects to create a link. In this demo you can press the L-key to switch between
indepent movement or linking yourself to the F16 aircraft.
Similarly you can bank the aircraft with the ',' and '.' keys.
